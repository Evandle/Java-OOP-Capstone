This system simulates a Grocery Shopping Experience where customers can browse and purchase products. Users must log in to make purchases; otherwise, an exception is thrown.
Customers can view available items, their prices, and stock levels, and create a shopping list to checkout, which displays selected items and the total amount.
Stock is managed via a CSV file, and out-of-stock items are disabled for selection. New users must sign up with a username, password (minimum 8 characters, including an uppercase letter and a number), and delivery address; invalid passwords trigger an exception.
Employees have dedicated access to manage stock, including adding/removing products and updating prices or quantities. A single admin account can manage users and handle stock.
